The volume fractions for a sphere are initialized. Care is taken to 
achieve high enough accuracy to avoid spurious errors. The curvature is computed
using the default method in Paris Simulator and compared to the method
used by Stéphane Popinet in basilisk. A series of diameter values 
are tested.  A total number of SAMPLESIZE spheres
are intialized with each diameter to check for all configurations, and
the maximum Linfinity norm for the set of spheres is shown. 

The height function method is used with a search depth of ndepth=NDEPTH.

The "ParisSim old method" uses mixed heights with no centroid added
to set of points begin fitted. The addition of the centroid of the face in the current
cell explains the improvement when using the current method displayed with
the tag "ParisSim current".
