  A water droplet in air with diameter 0.6 mm is set into oscillating motion. 
The graphs shows the velocity of the liquid near the apex. In the absence
of spurious currents and capillary waves, one expects a smooth solution 
following the reference solution. This test case does not use the Momentum
Conserving formulation.
